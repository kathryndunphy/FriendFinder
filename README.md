# Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers

###So what the heck is this thing?
The concept is for the user to be able to access a portion of a catalogue of human-profiles.    
  _assigning a compatibilty/likeness rating, or grading factor, to series of question-responses and matching the user's question-responses based on some unknown evaluation of importance:compatibility_**
  *After a short introduction of Name & Photo-required, we move on to a comprehensive psychological and personality assessment administered by 10 questions.
  *We then compare your packaged personality to our database of comprehensive packaged personalities of our users

### Overview

In this activity, you'll build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 

You will use Express to handle routing. Make sure you deploy your app to Heroku so other users can fill it out.
